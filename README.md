App Name: Your Anime Watchlist

Description: Your Anime Watchlist is a web-based application designed for anime enthusiasts to track and manage their anime viewing lists. Users can add, remove, and organize anime titles, marking them as watched, currently watching, or planned to watch. The app features a responsive, visually appealing japanese style interface, enhancing the user experience. Built with a focus on simplicity and accessibility, this project aims to provide a personalized tool for anime fans to stay organized. It was developed as a learning project to practice JavaScript-driven interactivity and responsive web design.

Background: Inspired by the need to keep track of an ever-growing list of anime to watch, this app was created to offer a streamlined, user-friendly solution for fans. The project draws from concepts in the General Assembly MEN stack guide, focusing on client-side functionality with plans for future backend integration.
